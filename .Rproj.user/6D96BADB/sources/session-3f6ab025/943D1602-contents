```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r cars}
directory <- "~/Documents/School/Thesis/project/"
data_folder <- "marmosets"

file <- "~/Documents/School/Thesis/project/data/macaques/M3/subject_M3_scan_1.csv"
test_scan <- read_csv(file)
test_result <- Rtsne(test_scan, initial_dims = 5, perplexity = 30)
result <- data.frame(x = test_result$Y[,1], y = test_result$Y[,2])
result$row <- seq_along(result$x)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
